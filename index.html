            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This website presents my analysis of New York City neighborhoods 
                along the 6 train line. I use walkability scores, Niche rankings, 
                demographic data, and commute times to explore urban quality of life.

            <h2>HC 3 – Computing Costs</h2>
            <p>
                In HC 3, I compared housing costs and commute times from several 
                neighborhoods to Midtown (Empire State Building) and the Financial 
                District (Federal Hall). The goal was to see how much extra rent 
                New Yorkers are willing to pay for a shorter commute.

            <h2>HC 4 – Subway Logo</h2>
            <p>
                For HC 4, I used <code>matplotlib</code> and hex color codes to design a 
                subway line logo. The logo is based on the IRT Lexington Avenue (6) line.
            </p>
            <!-- If you export your logo as subway_logo.png, put it in the repo and this will show it -->

            <h2>HC 5 – Initial Website</h2>
            <p>
                This GitHub Pages site is the initial skeleton for my course projects. 
                All code and analysis are version-controlled through GitHub.
            </p>

            <h2>HC 6 – Additional Data</h2>
            <p>
                I added demographic data (median income, median age, average rent, and 
                population) for five neighborhoods along the 6 line:
                Financial District, Upper East Side, East Harlem, Parkchester, and Pelham Bay.

            <h2>HC 7 – Analysis Plots</h2>
            <p>
                Using the expanded dataset, I created three plots to investigate what 
                features contribute most to the Niche ranking:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Walk Score vs. Niche Rank</li>
                <li>Median Income vs. Niche Rank</li>
                <li>Average Rent by Neighborhood</li>
            </ul>
